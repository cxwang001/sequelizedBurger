# sequelizedBurger

Node Express Handlebars with Sequelize this time.

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade Sequelize (yum!). The code follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The app has been deployed on Heroku.
